SUMMER PROJECT --- MACHINE LEARNING

*** FOOD DELIVERY TIME PREDICTION ***

We have used "RANDOM FOREST REGRESSOR" to predict the time required to deliver the ordered food item.
Our dataset consists of features { 'Restaurant_Name', 'Cuisine', 'Distance', 'Estimated Time Of delivery (ETD)' }
in which we have converted 'Cuisine' into Numerical values from Categorical. And used important features 'Cuisine' and 'Distance' to predict the ETD.
